# Calculator Application

This is a simple Java application that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication) through the command line.

## Usage

To use this calculator, you need to pass three command-line arguments:

1. The first argument should be an integer (num1).
2. The second argument should be an operator (+ for addition, \* for multiplication).
3. The third argument should be another integer (num2).

Here's how you can run the program from the command line:

```bash
java Main [num1] [operator] [num2]
```

## Example

To perform addition:

```bash
java Main 5 + 3
```

To perform multiplication:

```bash
java Main 5 * 3
```
